Businesses pay VAT on their purchases and collect it on their sales, remitting the difference to the government. Sales Tax, on the other hand, is a consumption tax collected only at the final point of sale to the end consumer."

              "@type": "Answer",
              "text": "Tax-inclusive pricing means the price displayed to the customer already includes the applicable sales tax or VAT. For example, if an item is priced at $120 in a country with 20% VAT, that $120 is the final price. To find the pre-tax price, you would use a 'Remove Tax' calculation. This model is common in Europe and many other parts of the world."

              "@type": "Answer",
              "text": "Accurate tax calculation is crucial for several reasons: 1) Legal Compliance: It ensures you collect and remit the correct amount of tax, avoiding penalties and audits. 2) Financial Health: It impacts your pricing strategy, profit margins, and cash flow. Incorrect calculations can lead to undercharging customers or overpaying the government. 3) Customer Trust: Transparent and accurate pricing builds credibility and trust with your customers."
